"""Findings:
1. The histogram demonstrates a right-skewed distribution of registered bike users, meaning that while there are generally fewer registered bike riders on most days, there are occasionally days with noticeably more users.
2. The bar plots displaying the median number of registered riders by month in 2011 and 2012 demonstrate how the median number of registered riders fluctuates in different months, with certain months having greater medians than others.
3. The hourly bar plot of the July median registered riders reveals peak hours during the day when the median number of registered riders is higher, suggesting periods of possible increased demand.
4. The demand fluctuates throughout the week, with certain days having higher median registered riders than others, as seen by the bar plot for median registered riders by day.
5. There is no discernible correlation between windspeed and the number of registered riders in the March 2011 scatter plot of windspeed vs. registered riders.

Business decision: Depending on the identified peak hours and days of higher demand, one business decision based on the insights from the exploratory analysis could be to modify bike availability and marketing efforts. Increasing the quantity of bikes available or implementing focused marketing campaigns on busy days and hours, for example, may draw in more clients and boost sales.
